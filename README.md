## Build
This project uses the [waf](https://waf.io/) build system.
To compile the project run, in the main directory
* `./waf configure`
* `./waf build`

The compiled binaries will be in the `build` directory.

To avoid having to call the build script from the project's main
directory you can copy `utils/waf` to `~/bin/waf`. Then the build
script can be called from any subdirectory of the project as `waf`.

## Test
The automated unit tests can be run with `./waf test`.
